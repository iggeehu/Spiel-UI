A UI take-home where I replicate a Figma mock-up into React Native Code

- The code is still not perfect:
  - The image of the restaurant should've been in a slider component (hence no slider dots)
  - Not all CSS values are passed dynamically
  - Some short-term solutions are used to style some navbar icons because I ran out of time
  - I tried to use strictly Figma values but some of the rendered result looks different =. I opted for "visual proximity" over "parameter proximity". 
  - a dropdown arrow is missing from the upper navbar.

### Rendered result
